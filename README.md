Deep Scanner
Deep Scanner is a robust, multi-modal scanning system that leverages deep learning to process images, videos, and audio. This project is divided into a backend (for processing and API handling) and a frontend (for a user-friendly interface), ensuring a smooth integration between your deep learning models and end-user experience.

Installation & Setup
Prerequisites
Node.js (v14+ recommended)
Git
A web browser
An active internet connection
Backend Setup
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/priyanshusoni3850/DEEP-SCANNER.git
cd DEEP-SCANNER/backend
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy
npm install
Ngrok Setup:

Create an account on ngrok and obtain your auth token.
In the backend code, locate the configuration file (or environment variable section) where the ngrok token is required and insert your token.
Start the Backend Server:

bash
Copy
npm start
Once the backend is successfully running, note the ngrok URL that appears in the console output.

Frontend Setup
Navigate to the Frontend Directory:

bash
Copy
cd ../frontend
Configure the Environment:

Create a .env file in the root of the frontend directory.

Add your ngrok link (from the backend startup) to the .env file as follows:

env
Copy
REACT_APP_API_URL=<your-ngrok-link>
Install Frontend Dependencies and Start:

bash
Copy
npm install
npm start
Usage
After both the backend and frontend are up and running:

Access the frontend through your web browser.
Upload or point to an image, video, or audio file.
The backend processes the input using the respective deep learning model.
Results are displayed on the frontend, with options to view detailed outputs.
